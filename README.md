# My Distributed Systems Lecture Notes

These are the sources of my Distributed Systems Course @ the Federal University of Uberl√¢ndia.
For the live current version, go to (https://lasarojc.github.io/ds_notes/)

To build your own version and deploy, use `mkdocs`

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `python3 -m pip upgrade pymdown-extensions`
* `python3 -m mkdocs serve` - and then access localhost:8000
* `python3 -m mkdocs gh-deploy` - then go to your project's site, like (https://lasarojc.github.io/ds_notes/)

because `mkdocs-drawio-exporter` you'll need to install Draw.io
